The SAMS Project is being delivered by a consortium of UK universities consisting of Exeter, Warwick, Cambridge and Sheffield. Its goal is to develop an open software framework for accurate modelling of the solar atmosphere to enhance our understanding of the solar atmosphere and assist in interpreting the cutting-edge observations produced by new observatories.
