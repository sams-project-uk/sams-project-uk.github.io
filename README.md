# SAMS Website

The SAMS website is built using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator. This is relatively easy to use and quite flexible. It is built automatically upon pushes to the `main` branch, and deploys to [https://sams-project-uk.github.io](https://sams-project-uk.github.io).
